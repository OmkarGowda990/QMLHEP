# Tasks for Quantum transformer for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC

The project description can be found [here](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2023/proposal_QMLHEP5.html) and the corresponding tasks are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqBGbH44Eu3W432oRxpOCfI5Dy2pgh2E21JcHeD0fng/edit)

File names are self sufficient to identify the tasks. Below are the clickable file links for each task.

I have not uploaded the datasets here as they are large in size. I link them here.
- For Task II, the [Quark/Gluon jet classification dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3164691#.YigdGt9MHrB).
